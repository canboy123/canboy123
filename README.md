## üèÜ Portfolio
### ML/DL/AI Web based System
#### [Adversarial Rank System](/adversarial_rank_system), Dongseo University ÎèôÏÑúÎåÄ
This is a web application based adversarial ranking system which allows a user to upload an image and view the adversarial image after the image is being distorted with an attack technique. It is also used for showing the ranking between several of attack and defense techniques.

#### [Port Code Prediction](/ecomarine), Ecomarine (Ï£º)ÏóêÏΩîÎßàÎ¶∞
This is a text classification which predicts a port code from an input (i.e. destination name).

#### [Engine Prediction](https://github.com/canboy123/ecomarine_engine_prediction), Ecomarine (Ï£º)ÏóêÏΩîÎßàÎ¶∞
This is a script to predict a ship engine's consumption (i.e. torque and fuel) from the speed value of the ship.

#### [AutoML-Zero](https://github.com/canboy123/automl_zero), Dongseo University ÎèôÏÑúÎåÄ
This is a web application based automated machine learning which allows a user to upload a dataset, and then train the dataset by searching the best network architecture for it and train the dataset for the classification task.
